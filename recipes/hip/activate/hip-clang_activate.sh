# -DAMDGPU_TARGETS=${CONDA_FORGE_DEFAULT_ROCM_GPU_TARGETS} (for packages taht still do not support GPU_TARGETS) or

# depending on the project
# See https://github.com/traversaro/rock-the-conda/issues/3#issuecomment-3317381230
# gfx1010 and gfx1012 were removed are not in for a problem in hipblaslt, see https://github.com/traversaro/rock-the-conda/issues/3#issuecomment-3419274585
# This list only contain the architectures, if a project needs to build for xnack- and xnack+ separetely
# for performance reason, the downstream recipe needs to expand the related element, i.e. change gfx908 to gfx908:xnack+;gfx908:xnack-
